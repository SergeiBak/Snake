## Overview
This project is a recreation of Snake, one of the most popular games that developers love to recreate. This solo project was developed in Unity using C# as part of my minigames series where I utilize various resources to remake simple games in order to further my learning as well as to have fun!   

Snake consists of a moving line that the player controls. As it consumes more apples, it grows in size and speeds up, making it more difficult to dodge walls as well as itself. See how big you can grow your snake!

## Test The Project!
In order to play this version of Snake, follow the [link](https://sergeibak.github.io/PersonalWebsite/Snake.html) to a in-browser WebGL build (No download required!).

## Code
A brief description of all of the classes is as follows:
- The `Food` class handles the positioning & repositioning of apples on the board.
- The `Snake` class handles player movement, collision, and the growing of the Snake when it eats apples.

## Technologies
- Unity
- Visual Studio
- GitHub
- GitHub Desktop

## Resources
- Credit goes to [Zigurous](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyaKsKqYTghxgAqywfefAzg) for the helpful base game tutorial!
